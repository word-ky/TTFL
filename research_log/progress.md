# T001 execution log

## 2026-09-13 11:25 +08 — takeover and environment

Local directory was empty. Cloned word-ky/TTFL main at 757c51f; read both coordination files. No baseline implementation/checkpoint or project logs existed. No applicable parent AGENTS.md found by project inventory; user global rules apply.

Located existing workflow at D:/work/claude-autodl/autodl-workflow-clean. Created isolated remote root /home/wenchang/asdasdsad/wjq/TTFL on wenchang-PR4904W1 (liujianhua). Both GPUs report NVIDIA RTX A6000 through PyTorch with ~50.6GB free. NVML fails due kernel580.173.02/library580.178 mismatch; actual CUDA tensor allocation succeeds. No driver change. Use physical GPU0. Existing TOVD job left running.

Created TTFL/.venv with system site packages (Python3.12.12 / torch2.4.0+cu121), added torchvision0.19.0 and Pillow because imports demonstrated those were absent. No existing Digits data found in bounded wjq search. Dataset acquisition is required.

Implementation mode: Complete new small baseline (not V1 reproduction). Reuse torchvision dataset loaders and torch layers/SGD/Adam/evaluation primitives. No donor research code/checkpoint found or copied. Build baseline and exercise training/checkpoint roundtrip before adding affine adaptation. Then test neutrality/frozen weights/split disjointness and paired context runner. No SSL/meta/FL or T002 in this work package.

## 2026-09-13 11:29 +08 — first increments
Baseline train/save/load/metric test passed. Added explicit external gamma/beta state, supervised SGD with frozen eval-mode backbone, and BN recalibration. All 5 focused tests passed locally (3.993s). Initial data run failed: original MNIST endpoint404 and conda CA trust error; public CVDF mirror alone also hits CA trust error. Retrying with OS CA bundle, retaining certificate verification. No scientific run yet.
